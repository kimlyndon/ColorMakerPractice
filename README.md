# ColorMakerPractice
## UIKit Fundamentals Lesson 1 Outlets and Actions

### Practice building the Color Maker app from scratch using sliders instead of switches. 

This project encompassed the lessons about connecting, assessing, and modifying Outlets and Actions. Instead of copying the project and only modifying the slider portion, I added my own flair to the project by changing the font, the size of the color viewer, and centering the label text within the view instead of aligning it to the left.
